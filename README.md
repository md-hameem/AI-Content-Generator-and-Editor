# Streamlit AI Content Generator + Editor Agent

## Overview

The **Streamlit AI Content Generator + Editor** is a fully interactive, web-based tool designed to assist content creators, marketers, and developers in generating high-quality blog posts, articles, and marketing copy. Leveraging **OpenAI** (or **Ollama** for local inference) for content generation, this app provides features like:

- Automatic content generation based on user input (topic, keywords, audience, tone)
- AI-driven draft improvement for better readability and conciseness
- Built-in SEO checks to optimize content for search engines
- Markdown and PDF export capabilities for easy use in any platform
- Customizable themes and branding for personalization

The app runs locally and can be easily set up for your own use or customized further to meet specific needs.
